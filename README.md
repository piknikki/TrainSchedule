# TrainSchedule

# Overview
The user enters basic train information, including name, destination, first train time, and frequency of trains in minutes. The app will then store that information in Firebase, and retrieve it and display it in the table.  Additional information displayed will be the next arrival time of that train, using moment.js to make that calculation.
